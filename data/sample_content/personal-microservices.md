# Personal Microservices

Like modern day servants, personal microservices are always ready to answer to your call. They place the power, availablity, and scalbility of online computing at your command. 

The cloud gives us scale and makes online computing cheap. Personal microservices make it possible to decouple online application delivery from scalable online computation delivery and data ownership.

Imagine a world where your pictures, your contacts, your health data, your location are seamlessly linked from your devices to a space you own yourself, where you control how it's shared with other people and organizations.

Personal microservices mean you pay for the server capacity you use. You are not an advertising target, you are not a content provider generating content for an advertising payload, you are not subject to arbitrary terms and conditions or opaque algorithms. (There is nothing in the AWS terms and conditions about the relative acceptablity of male and female human nipples.)

Because you install them into your own cloud account, you own all the data you generate. Because you configure the software yourself, no-one is manipulating your experience to control your behaviour. Because services are written with APIs and events in mind, multiple services can collaborate. Because you own your data and identity, online collaboration can be grounded on new foundations of consent.

Welcome to the future. Install Seehund to get started.
